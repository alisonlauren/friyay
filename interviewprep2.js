//1. Do you use es6? Why or why not.
// I do use es6, the advantages to es6 are first, arrow functions which is a convenient shorthand.
//Also, with classes, which support inheritance, instance and static methods which makes for a more user friendly experience
// ability to load and manage dependencies through import and export keywords
//ability to destructure

//2. What is hoisting?
// Hoisting is JavaScript's default behavior of moving all declarations to the top of the current 
//scope (to the top of the current script or the current function). Meaning: The block of code is aware of the variable, 
//but it cannot be used until it has been declared.
//To avoid bugs, always declare all variables at the beginning of every scope.

//3. What is a callback? what is the air style for callbacks?
//in your arguements you expect that error first and results second.


//4. When to use promises over callbacks?
//Es5 style is just callbacks, promises is more 5s6.
//callbacks consume very little CPU time, callbacks may be needed when interacting with another system
//callbacks are great when the order of operations isnt important
//The Promise API allows you to query the state of the underlying async event,
// and has methods that allow you to register logic to handle the result or error generated

//5. What are the pros and cons of Javascript?
// personally, its the language i know the best so it's difficult for me to answer
//because I don't have much understanding of other languages. I do know that
//one advantage is that javascript very closely resemebles the english language and
//presents readable code. Due to it's popularity there are so many resources
//for me to reach out and learn more on. 
//also tens to be fast because it runs immedieatly within the clients browser.

//6. What is an IIFE?
//immediately invoked function expression, very useful in JS.
//essential in building in jquery. ruuns immediatly after being defined.

//7. What is your coding style?
//small one liners/built in function?
//to the point or UI friendly
//OOP, because it helps to keep dry code. classes and objects are
//two main aspects of oop.

//8. Dot vs bracket notation?
//let sound = obj.cat; vs// let sound = obj[cat]
//dot notation may be more readable, but its not significantly so.
//bracket notation is more flexible on use of variables, spacing and starting with numbers

//9. How do you write clean code in JS?
//name your variables well, write neccessary comments.
