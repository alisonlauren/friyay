//1. Live Code Solution 1:
//Given an array of random srings, Write a function that will return a new array 
//with only the words that contain the letter e.

randomStrings = ['elephant', 'cat', 'pEnguin', 'bird', 'dog', 'rat', 'lion', 'parrot']




//2. Live Code Solution 2:
// Given an array of random strings. Write a function that will return a new array
//with only the words that are 4 letters or more.




// Independent Code Solution 1:

// Write a function that takes two agruements, String1 and String2. Join these strings together
// and reverse the newString.





//Independent Code Solution 2:
//Write a function that, given a string, will always return the 4th charachter. And if
//the string is too short, the console will print "too short of a string".
